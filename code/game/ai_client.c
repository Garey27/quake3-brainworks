======================
LevelPlayerAreasUpdate

FIXME: Not all areas are navigatable with TFL_DEFAULT.
When the bot jumps off a ledge, it's well within the
realm of probability that it will pass through some
areas that it cannot navigate into or out of.  This
will result in the bot selecting no goal and no item
for that frame.  This isn't a big deal because the
bots (apparently) don't move in air anyway, and the
bot will quickly enter a ground area from which they
can navigate.  So technically the check that only
updates for non-zero areas could be expanded to exclude
these other non-navigatable areas.

In theory, the item pickup code (which predicts travel
times to a wide variety of areas) could check if all
tested routes out of an area were unnavigatable.  If
that were the case, the bot's current area could get
added to a list of areas to avoid.  (Actually, it would
be an array of boolean values where "true" means "don't
update the bot's area to this value", and is initialized
to all falses except 0 which is true.)

That said, this is an awful lot of trouble to patch an
apparent issue with the internal engine, and there
doesn't seem to be a real payoff for doing so.  So this
fix has not been implemented.  But if a large bug
occurs from the bot entering non-navigatable areas,
it's relatively easy (for the processor, not the code)
to prune out these areas in real-time.

	// bot state.  Of course, this saves about 150 nanoseconds per call on a 1ghz
	// processor.  A rough estimate says this will save .15 milliseconds per second
	// of processing time.  I don't think creating this data cache is worth the
