equally dangerous, and 1 if A is more dangerous than B.

BotDodgeMissile

Evaluate how dangerous a missile makes a given location
in terms of both splash damage proximity and missile heading.

The missile splash damage value is added to the dodge info's
damage rating.  If this missile is better aimed than previous
missiles (as noted by info->heading), then the new heading's
dot product is saved as well.  Lower dot product headings
(closest to a right angle) are prefered over higher dot products
(closest to colinear with missile path).

BotCreateDodge

Try to create a new dodge information entry to
a dodge info list for the inputted direction.
Returns NULL if it could not be created (perhaps
the dodge would make the bot fall into a pit) and
returns a pointer to the new dodge entry otherwise.
When this function returns a valid pointer, it sets
up the contents of that structure.  The contents
of num_dodges will be incremented as well.

"axis" represents the bot's axies of movement.  If
"moving" is true, the forward axis points towards
the bot's destination.  Otherwise the forward axis
refers to the bot's forward view.

NOTE: The first entry in the dodge list (ie. the first
time this function is called per list) must be for
dodge direction bs->dodge.

FIXME: This "feature" feels inellegant.  Can it
be made more ellegant somehow?
