Estimates how much lead time will be necessary for
the bot to hit the a target with the inputted weapon
that is offset "origin" from the bot's current position
with velocity "velocity".  "lag" is the amount of time
the target will move before the bot's shot gets processed
by the server.

NOTE: This time is just an estimate.  Guaranteeing a
perfect shot requires an arbitrarily large number
of enemy prediction extrapolations, and even one
such function call is processor intense.

	// moves at speed s ("speed").  The missile doesn't start shooting until
	// time l ("lag").
	//
	// The target's position at time t will be p + t*v, and the distance the

	// function is to find the time t such that |p + t*v| = s*(t-l).  It's easier
	// to avoid the square roots though, so this equation is simpler to solve:
	//
	//   |p + t*v|^2 - (s*(t-l))^2 = 0
	//
	// This is just:
	//
	//   [ Dot(p,p) + Dot(p,v)*2*t + Dot(v,v)*t^2 ] - [ s^2 * (t-l)^2 ] = 0
	//   [ Dot(p,p) + Dot(p,v)*2*t + Dot(v,v)*t^2 ] - [ s^2*t^2 - 2*s^2*l*t + s^2*l^2 ] = 0

	//   c = Dot(p,p) - s^2*l^2
	//   disc = b^2 - 4ac

	//   a = 0, b = 0, c != 0: No solutions

	// would take for the missile to contact the target if it were stationary.

BotTargetBoundingBoxExpand

Expands the attack target's bounding box by the percent inputted
by "scale".  For example, if scale is 1.5, the new box
will be 1.5x the size of the old one.  This function only increases
the two axies most perpendicular to offset vector between the target
and the bot.  It also never expands in the Z direction if the target
can't move in that axis.

This function essentially creates an "error space" of potential
locations the target might end up in, so the bot can shoot if its
shots would hit anything in that range.  It is used by rapid fire
weapons where careful aiming is not needed.

NOTE: Do not use this function to shrink bounding boxes (scale < 1).
Doing so could cause the bot's shot location to be located outside
of the bounding box.  This means the bot could be perfectly lined
up with its shot location, but it would never shoot because that
location wouldn't be inside the box.  Use BotTargetBoundingBoxShrink()
to shrink boxes.

BotTargetBoundingBoxShrink

Shrinks the attack target's bounding box by the percent inputted by
"scale".  For example, if scale is 0.9, the new box will be 0.9x the
size of the old one.  This function always shrinks all three axies,
unlike its expansion counterpart

This function essentially compensates for a margin of error, guaranteeing
that any shot landing on this bounding box will hit the target (assuming
the target moved in the predicted manner).  This compensates for any minor
prediction errors.  It is used by slow fire weapons where careful aiming
is not required.

NOTE: Do not use this function to expand bounding boxes (scale > 1).
Doing so would expand all axies, which could cause the expanded box to
contain the bot's fire location.  In such a case, the bot would always
think it's shot would hit no matter where it aimed.  Use
BotTargetBoundingBoxExpand() to expand boxes.

FIXME: Perhaps the functions could be merged together into a
BotTargetBoundingBoxScale() function and the input value of scale
could arbitrate which of these functions gets called.

BotAttackPredict

Predicts the attack target's motion, adjusting for things like
lag and the time it will take for missile shots to reach the
target.  This function assumes the bot will shoot at the target
with weapon number "weapon".  The target's motion state,
bs->attack.motion, is lagged "lag" seconds behind the time at
which the server will process the bot's next command.

If prediction is needed, this function will adjust the motion state
contents accordingly, along with the attack state's shot location.
(It's almost guaranteed prediction will be needed for lag compensation,
not to mention for missile shots.)

Returns true if a new aim target was was selected and that
location can be seen (ie. shot at).  Returns false all other
times, including when the aim target didn't change.

NOTE: Just because the center of a player's body is occluded
doesn't mean the bot can't hit them.  For example, if a player is
dodging past an area that covers the upper half of their body but
not their feet, the bot will still try blast shots under the
overhang.
