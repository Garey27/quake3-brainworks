the enemy is allowed to use in these zones, analogous to

BotRouteJump

Patch bugs in the movement engine for jumping

NOTE: This function may invalidate the contents of *route.

NOTE: There is another bug with TFL_WATERJUMP that cannot be
fixed here.  You can see it on q3dm12 when the bot tries to
swim out of the water to the BFG room.  The movement engine
overestimates the maximum height allowed for TFL_WATERJUMP
and the bot gets stuck because of it.
