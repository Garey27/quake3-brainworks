	// - The aim view state must updated and then repackaged in the command
	//   structure every server frame, and whenever the bot changes aim selection
	// - Movement processing must occur after all aiming and movement modifiers
	//   (including dodging) have been run.  It also uses the processed view
	//   angles, so it must occur after the view processing.
	// - The test if the bot wants to fire must occur after the aim update,
	//   or the bot will constantly make its fire decisions based on last
	//   frame's aiming (causing a lot of misses for weapons like railgun).
	//   It also must occur after the movement processing, since the server
	//   moves the bot before letting it shoot, so the bot must know how it's
	//   movement will affect its starting fire location.
	// - The actual firing must occur after deciding whether or not to fire
	//   for the next few milliseconds from attack check.  This occurs every
	//   frame because it must occur bot in every logical frame (ie. when the
	//   bot decides to shoot) and in every reflexive frame (ie. when the bot
	//   continues to shoot because it shot last frame).  The actual code is
	//   small so executing it in every AI frame isn't a big speed loss.

BotActions

Runs any appropriate actions for the given bot.  "ai_elapsed"
is the number of seconds passed since this function was last
called.  "game_elapsed" is the amount of that server_time has
increased (converted from milliseconds to seconds) since this
function was last called for this bot, or 0 if the level has
not been updated since the last action execution.

There are three kinds of actions a human takes:
 - Subconscious (eg. heartbeat)
 - Reflexive (eg. breathing)
 - Logical (eg. walking)

Subconscious actions are ones that can't really be
controlled.  They just happen automatically, and happen
at a very regular pace.  Reflexive actions are things
humans do without really thinking about them, but they
are conscious of them.  People don't really think about
breathing, but they can stop breathing if they choose
to do so.  Logical actions are anything that requires
conscious thought-- where a person wants to move, what
they say, and so on.

Unsurprisingly, the actions a bot must take fall under
similar catagories.  To a bot, subconscious actions are
actions that interface with the rest of the code.  This
includes things like processing where the bot should
look, what commands the bot actually sends to the server,
and so on.  Subconscious actions must execute as often
as possible-- once every time this function is called.

The bot's reflexive actions are reactions to the game
state.  For example, scanning for nearby enemies is a
reaction to the change in enemy locations in the level.
So reflexive actions must execute whenever the level
state changes.  In general, these reactions only need
to trigger once per level frame.  However, it's possible
that some reflexive actions will get processed a second
time if the logical thought changes the kind of reactions
the bot should have (eg. a fight or flight change).

A bot's logical decisions cover pretty much everything
else-- where the bot should move (goal selection), how
it should get there (move selection), and what it should
look at in the mean time (aim selection).  Weapon selection,
firing, and dodging are also part of the logical decisions.
In general, logic decisions require a lot of processing.
As such, they should not execute every AI Frame.  Instead,
logically processing is deferred until a specified amount
of time has accrued.  At that time, all of the logical
decisions will be made for the time past.  This time is
set by the bot_thinktime variable (which counts in
milliseconds).  It's not that useful to set this variable
less than the frame execution time (50 ms), and setting it
too high (maybe 200ms or higher) could create bots that feel
rather stiff.

To summarize bot actions:
 - Subconscious: Executes every AI Frame
 - Reflexive: Executes once per level frame
 - Logical: Executes once per set interval

When this function executes, it determines what kinds of
processing it will do.  Reflexive code will be processed
if "game_elapsed is non-zero".  Similarly, if logic_elapsed
is 0 no logical processing will be done.
