MoveCmdToDesiredDir

Given a movement command, computes the desired
direction and speed of that movement, projected
onto the ground plane (if any).  The unitized
direction is stored in the "dir" vector and the
speed (magnitude) is the function's return value.

"axies" are the forward, right, and up axial direction
vectors for movement.  Note that the up direction
vector isn't actually used.

"physics" is the physics description that
applies to this command set.

"max_speed" is the entity's maximum movement speed.
That is, it's the velocity in units per second if
the command's forward move value is 127.

"water_level" is the entity's water level (1 for
wading, 2 for chest deep, 3 for immersed, 0 for no
water).  Presumably if the water level is 2 or higher,
the physics type will be PHYS_WATER, although this
isn't guaranteed.

FIXME: This function's interface could be simplified
if just a motion state pointer was passed in instead
of the user command, axies, maximum speed, and water
level.  The downside is that the user command and
axies would either need to be recomputed each call
or stored in the motion state.  One of these options
uses more processing time that necessary and the other
uses more memory than necessary.  Still, it might be
in the interest of cleanliness to spend more time or
memory for this purpose.  Or it might not.
