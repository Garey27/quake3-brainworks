	// this from being easily done.
	//
	// This is because Quake 3 updates each player in order, first moving
	// the player and then shooting.  So if a bot with client number 1 is
	// killed by client 0, the bot won't get to shoot-- it will be dead
	// before it's ClientThink() executes.  (And because of another bug in
	// PM_Weapon() in bg_pmove.c, the bot's ps->weaponTime value will not
	// decrease, so it appears as if another shot has been taken by the
	// dead bot.)  But if the bot is killed by client 2, the bot will still
	// have gotten the shot off, and in theory the accuracy data could be
	// tracked.  Some extra effort is needed, however, because the bot's
	// current weapon (bs->ps->weapon) will be set to WP_NONE, even though
	// the shot would have been made with the old weapon, presumably
	// bs->weapon.  But most of the time bs->ps->weapon should be used
	// (see below).
	//
	// Unfortunately, the only way to track this is to check who killed
	// the bot and compare client numbers.  And there's still the issue
	// of ps->weaponTime not being effectively updated.  (Usually the bug
	// causes a 50ms accrual difference, but this value could be larger
	// if the server was processor lagged, so the value is unpredictable.)
	//
	// NOTE: These issues only apply to instant hit weapons, which can only
	// be detected by their reload times.  The bot tracks accuracy data for
	// missiles in BotTrackMissileShot() in ai_scan.c.

	// player dies.

	//
	// NOTE: A bug in PM_Weapon() in bg_pmove.c causes the code to not decay
	// bs->ps->weaponTime if the player uses an item.  This is perceived by the
	// AI code as an time increase, which could be inappropriately be read as a
	// shot.  As such, all shots read when the bot uses an item are ignored.
	// Incidently, players are not allowed to use a holdable item and shoot at
	// the same time

/*
=================
BotAccuracyUpdate

This function processes the bot's missile and hitscan
fire data to track the bot's attack hits and misses.

The fundamental theme of this function (and the functions
it calls) is that correctly determining hits and misses
is almost impossible.  The server infrastructure simply
doesn't allow for it.  In fact, even determining whether
or not the bot's weapon fired is difficult.

The server uses the bs->ps->persistant[PERS_HITS] tally
counter to send damage ticks to the client.  When this
value is incremented, the client plays a *DING*.  It's
also decremented when a teammate is hurt.  So for example
if a bot uses the Kamikaze and damages one teammate and
one enemy, the tally counter will get -1 for the teammate
and +1 for the enemy, which will read as zero change.  So
there's no possible way for the bot to determine how many
hits were actually scored.  Similar problems can occur
when friendly fire is on, with a missile blast damaging
an enemy and an opponent.

There are other issues with missile fire.  Suppose the bot
fires a grenade and then switches to the machinegun.  It
shot last frame and hears a *DING*-- is that from the grenade
exploding or the machinegun shot?  It's very difficult to
determine.

And there are other issues as well, not described here.  If
you see anything in these functions that might not give
accurate data, rest assured that it bothers me too.  I do
the best I can, but I cannot modify the client/server
infrastructure.
