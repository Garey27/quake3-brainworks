a speed powerup reducing travel time).  "player_rate" is the

"enemy_rate" is the percentage of "time" that enemies will
spend attacking the player.  "score" is the number of points
the player will earn for attacking the most valuable enemy

Players that are predicted to die will not score points after
their predicted death, but the prediction will still continue.

won't die then, and they'll have an opportunity to pickup
health.)
