extremely difficult to appropriately name the

BotMotionFutureUpdate

This function updates the bot's prediction of
its motion state for the upcoming server frame
(bs->future) if necessary.  "Necessary" means
it hasn't been updated yet or critical information
has changed since it was last updated (ie. the
bot changed its commands.)

NOTE: You may wonder why the bot even needs a
perception of its own position next server frame.
It turns out that there are some significant
problems with parallax view if the bot doesn't
reference future motion state data when deciding
some important features like attacking (although
that isn't the only code that benefits from this).
Since the server processes movement data before
shot data, parallax view issues generate a 10% to
20% drop in weapon accuracies.  This code makes it
possible to correct that error.
