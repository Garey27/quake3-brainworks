BotEntityVisibleFast

Does a fast check to determine if an entity is probably visible.
Only checks if the entity's center is in line-of-sight of the
eye location, so it won't catch cases where the entity is more
than 50% occluded but still visible (eg. halfway behind a pillar).

This code is guaranteed to take exactly one trace.  It's best
used when precision is not needed and the function is likely to
get called a fair number of times.  If precision is needed or
you have spare cycles, use BotEntityVisible or BotEntityVisibleCenter
instead.
