BotEntityLatency

Returns the estimated amount of latency the bot has relative
to this entity.  The latency is the estimated amount of time
the entity will update before the server processes the bot's
next command.

FIXME: This code currently estimates the amount of latency
for humans in a fairly analog manner-- however much time is
left until the server updates is the amount the player will
update.  Unfortunately, updates are a very digital thing.
The player either updates in one big chunk or not.

For example, suppose a player pings at 80 ms (ie. one command
every 80 milliseconds) and the last command was received 10 ms
ago.  Now suppose there are 25 ms until the server updates
again.  It's a pretty safe assumption that this semi-lagged
player will update ZERO milliseconds before the server
processes the bot commands, not 25 ms.  These estimates are
pretty accurate for fast connections (especially local players)
though.  It's possible to apply some algorithm to statistically
analyse the standard deviation of the player's lag and get a
pretty good idea if the player will send a new frame between
now and the next update.  If an update would occur, the full
latency time of 80 ms (or whatever their average command time
differential is) would be returned.  Otherwise 0 is returned.
This would improve the bots' ability to track lagged players
connected to the server, especially those with pings greater
than twice SERVER_FRAME_DURATION.

/*
=====================
BotEntityMotionLagged

This function attempts to find (or estimate) one state of an
entity's motion data such that the bot must predict exactly "lag"
seconds to estimate the entity's state at the time the bot next
executes a command.  In other words, this function generates
entity data that's lagged by a constant amount-- in particular,
by "lag" seconds.

This function returns the actual number of seconds the bot needs
to predict ahead to estimate the entity's state at the bot's next
command execution.  Ideally this will always be "lag" seconds, but
it's possible this code won't have enough old historical motion
data to do this.  The returned value could be as low as zero seconds,
if no historical data was kept and the bot's next command should
execute as soon as this AI frame finishes.

Conversely, it's also possible that the returned amount of lag
will be higher than the requested input.  This can occur when it
will take a while before the bot's next command is executed, and
the caller only requested a small amount of lag.  If the bot in such
a situation requests data on an entity that updates very quickly
(like a player with a low ping), there's a fixed amount of lag that
the bot simply cannot get around.

So the moral is that while this function tries to return "lag"
seconds, it might just do the best it can.  It's really important
for the caller to respect the return value of this function.
