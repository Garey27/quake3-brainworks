The Quake 3 code really does have two different kinds of
bounding boxes, and uses the world box in some situations
and the local box in others.  This is of course complicated
by movers which do not have a local box, but the AI code must
infer what it would be set to when necessary.  Some entities
also have no center origin but use their local minimums and
maximums as the world bounding box.  It's a huge mess and this
