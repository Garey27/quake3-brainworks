/*
===================
BotPredictGoalRoute

This function first checks if the bot can move to a requested input
goal (possibly deactivating obstacles to make the route feasible).
If "shoot" is true, it also checks if the bot can shoot the goal
with a non-gauntlet weapon.  If this is not possible, the function
returns false and permanently changes no other data values.  Otherwise
the function will return true.

When this function returns true, it also tries to compute a subgoal
the bot could directly move to without deactivating any obstacles.
Note that this subgoal could be a button that deactivates an obstacle
blocking the requested goal, or it could be the requested input goal
itself.  If such a subgoal exists, it will be saved in the "subgoal"
pointer.  The travel time from the bot to this subgoal will be
saved in "subgoal_time", and if the subgoal is an activator that
should be shot, true is stored in "subgoal_shoot".

It's worth noting that this function is guaranteed to compute a
reachable subgoal.  Subgoal might be NULL, but it will never be a
goal that is currently blocked by obstacles.  This property is very
important, since the function is recursive.

The encounter list is a list of obstacles the bot has encountered in
the process of this route prediction.  If BotPathObstacle() detects
an obstacle in this list, the bot won't try deactivating it a second time.
Every obstacle in this list is either deactivatable (in which case the
bot only needs to do it once) or not (in which case the bot fails).  But
there's never a reason to process it twice.
